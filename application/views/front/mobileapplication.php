					<p>The basic need behind developing the mobile application is
					to bring the globe on your fingertip. Other hand, we try to bring your 
					work place in your hand, you can operate it by sitting wherever you want to.
					As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is 
					also essential in the creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers 
					constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. 
					User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output
					allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation.  
					The UI of mobile apps should: consider users' limited attention, minimize
					keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions.</p>

</p>
	
	<p>However, building an Android app is not exactly an easy task, and developers follow certain Android app development steps for making the app a success.</p>

	<p>To get a fair idea of the massive popularity that apps enjoy in this time and age, consider this: the most popular digital distribution platform in the world, Apple’s App Store has over 1.5 million unique apps, with a combined download figure of a whopping 100 billion apps till date! By the time you read this sentence, about 1000 apps have already been downloaded and installed on a similar number of iPhones. And the numbers are on an exponential rise.</p>
	
	<p>But even with of all its ease of access and sheer user friendliness, designing, developing and publishing an app is an awfully arduous process. From development to actually getting your app out on the App Store, the road that an app must traverse is lengthy and is by no means, a bed of roses.</p>

						 <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right list-icon"></i><strong>Development:</strong> Native apps for iOS are developed using the iOS Software Development Kit or the iOS SDK. Just like the Mac, iOS SDK is based on Xcode IDE and is programmed using Apple’s proprietary coding language called Swift.</li>
						 <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right list-icon"></i>How much time does it takes to develop would depend on various factors. Things like number of components, the types of components like the tabs, image views, map views and the integration complexity of all these components need to be considered.</li>
						 <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right list-icon"></i><strong>Testingand and publishing:</strong>Having an iOS app developed and ready at hand is a job half done. The real task is getting it published on the App Store. Apple is infamous for its stringent App Review Guidelines and a high app rejection rate. </li>
						 <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right list-icon"></i>Before an app is submitted to Apple for review, it must be thoroughly tested on all the target devices.</li>
